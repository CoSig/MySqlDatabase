To many of my customers, the entire process seems like some sort of alchemy they dare not try at home.... Ten years ago, Clare Cosi left an unhappy marriage along with a job she loved: managing the historic Village Blend coffeehouse in New York\'s Greenwich Village. For a decade, she was happy raising her daughter in the quiet suburbs of New Jersey; but now that Joy is grown and gone, life has gotten way too quiet for Clare. With a little cajoling from Madame, the Blend\'s flamboyant, elderly owner, Clare agrees to return to her old job, and right from the start she gets one heck of a jolt. On her first morning back as Village Blend manager, Clare unlocks the front door to find her beautiful, young assistant manager unconscious in the back of the store, coffee grounds strewn everywhere. As Anabelle is rushed to the hospital, police arrive to investigate, but Detective Mike Quinn finds no sign of forced entry or foul play, and he deems it an accident. Clare disagrees; and after Quinn leaves, there are a few questions she just can\'t get out of her mind, like why was the trash bin in the wrong place?  If this wasn\'t an accident, are her other baristas in danger? And are all NYPD detectives this attractive?	Coffeehouse Mysteries, No. 1	Mystery	''

New Yorker Clare Cosi manages a coffee shop, but this summer she\'ll leave it behind as she heads for the Hamptons-and perhaps the biggest jolt of her life... Clare Cosi\'s new friend, millionaire David Mintzer, has an offer no New York barista could turn down: an all-expenses-paid summer away from the sticky city. At his Hamptons mansion, she\'ll relax, soak up the sun, and, oh yes, train the staff of his new restaurant. So Clare packs up her daughter, her former mother-in-law, and her special recipe for iced coffee-for what she hopes will be one de-latte-ful summer... Soon, Clare tends the coffee bar at her first Hamptons gala. But the festivities come to a bitter end when an employee turns up dead in David\'s bathroom-a botched attempt on the millionaire\'s life. Thanks to the Fourth of July fireworks no one heard any gunshots, and the police are stuck in holiday traffic. Concerned for everyone\'s safety, Clare begins to investigate.  What she finds will keep her up at night-and it\'s not the java jitters...\" --This text refers to the Kindle Edition edition.	Coffeehouse Mysteries, No. 4	Mystery	''

In his international bestseller The Game, Neil Strauss delved into the secret world of pick-up artists--men who have created a science out of the art of seduction.  Not only did he reveal the techniques that they had developed, but he became a master of The Game, and the world\'s No. 1 PUA, as Style.  Now, in his first follow-up to The Game, comes an extraordinary package: A lavishly produced, two-volume pocket-size set that every pickup artist--accomplished or aspiring--will need to have. The first book, The Stylelife Challenge, is the manual Strauss thought he\'d never write: the ultimate guide to landing the woman of your dreams. Bound in white leatherette, it offers an in-depth 30-day program, Strauss challenges readers to confront their insecurities and overcome them through a process of rigorous self-examination, briefings and field missions.  In the second book, Strauss takes readers into the dark side of The Game. Bound in black leatherette, The Style Diaries offers a series of tales of seduction and sexual (mis)adventure. From accidentally getting married during a drunken night in Reykjavik, to luring a famous musician\'s granddaughter into a threesome; from conducting a keenly felt and tender relationship over email, to the stress and frustration of the torturous and highly unorthodox \"30 Day Sex Experiment,\" The Style Diaries takes you further into the seduction underworld than ever before, and delves where The Game never dared to tread: into the even more complicated rules of relationships.

Now Penelope not only believes in her hard-boiled ghost, she asks for his help in solving a murder.  A loyal customer of Penelope\'s bookshop has been found dead on posh Larchmont Avenue. The elderly woman left a will that was recently (and suspiciously) revised to name her mailman, Seymour Tarnish, the sole heir to her estate. Many eyes in the little town turn to the hapless mailman as the murderer, including the town\'s police chief, but Seymour doesn\'t care. He\'s too busy settling into his posh new digs. Unfortunately, Seymour\'s new mansion also appears to be haunted and when the mansion\'s ghosts begin plaguing him, he hires a team of parapsychologists to exorcise every last spirit from the entire town.  Now Penelope must not only solve a murder, and prove her friend Seymour innocent, she must act fast to save her beloved ghost; because if these \"spirit zappers\" actually do their job, then the ghost of Jack Shepard finally will be history. And that scares Pen a lot more than rattling chains and cold spots.	Haunted Bookshop Mysteries, No. 5	Mystery	''

Murray Rothbard	The Mystery of Banking	20.00	15.00	10.00	5.00	Ludwig von Mises Institute	September 10, 2008	3	0	0	0	English	1933550287	978-1933550282	hardcover	298	Talk about great timing. Rothbard\'s extraordinary book unravels the mystery of banking: what is legitimate enterprise and what is a government-backed shell game that can\'t last. His explanation is clear enough for anyone to follow and yet precise and rigorous enough to be the best, textbook for college classes on the topic. This is because its expositional clarity--in its hitosry and theory--is essentially unrivaled.  Most notably, he uses the T account method of explaining the relationship between deposits and loans, showing the inherent instability of fractional reserve banking and how it sets the stage for centralization, inflation, and the boost-bust cycle.  But there is more here. It is an explanation of money\'s origins and its meaning in the free market. The abstract theory is here but always with real application in history and in modern banking practice. Never does a paragraph go by without an example drawn from his massive knowledge of the subject. Even further, he explains the integration between microeconomics and the business cycle. As Douglas French writes in the introduction: Although first published 25 years ago, Murray Rothbard s The Mystery of Banking continues to be the only book that clearly and concisely explains the modern fractional reserve banking system, its origins, and its devastating effects on the lives of every man, woman, and child. It is especially appropriate in a year that will see; a surge in bank failures, central banks around the globe bailing out failed commercial and investment banks, double-digit inflation rates in many parts of the world and hyperinflation completely destroying Zimbabwe s economy, that a new edition of Rothbard s classic work be republished and made available through the efforts of Lew Rockwell and the staff at the Ludwig on Mises Institute. Priced affordably for students and laymen interested in the agaries of banking and how inflation and business cycles are created. Further, Joseph Salerno explains in the Foreword: The Mystery of Banking is perhaps the least appreciated work among Murray Rothbard s prodigious body of output. This is a shame because it is a model of how to apply sound economic theory, dispassionately and objectively, to the origins and development of real-world institutions and to assess their consequences. It is institutional economics at its best. In this book, the institution under scrutiny is central banking as historically embodied in the Federal Reserve System the Fed for short the central bank of the United States. Rothbard s presentation of the basic principles of money-and-banking theory in the first eleven chapters of the book guides the reader in unraveling the mystery of how the central bank operates to create money through the fractional-reserve banking system and how this leads to inflation of the money supply and a rise in overall prices in the economy. But he does not stop there. In the subsequent five chapters he resolves the historical mystery of how an inherently inflationary institution like central banking, which is destructive of the alue of money and, in the extreme case of hyperinflation, of money itself, came into being and was accepted as essential to the operation of the market economy. Incredibly, both authors correctly anticipate the current crisis -- and Rothbard explains it all and shows the way out. This is certainly the book for today, more essential than ever before.

Scott Hahn , Mike Aquilina	Living the Mysteries: A Guide for Unfinished Christians	10.17	5.08	2.54		Our Sunday Visitor	September 30, 2003	4	0	0		English	1931709122	978-1931709125	paperback	352	Until we get to heaven, we\'re all unfinished Christians.  There are no \"self-made\" success stories in the spiritual life. No do-it-yourself kits for aspiring saints. That\'s why Living the Mysteries is ideal for a family member, friend, or fellow parishioner who was recently in the RCIA program and received the sacraments of initiation - baptism, confirmation, and the Eucharist - at the Easter Vigil. That\'s why it\'s perfect for a lifelong Catholic, too.  The early Church had a process in which a teacher guided seekers through stages of inquiry and purification, culminating in a final phase called \"mystagogy\" -- MIST-a-go-gee -- \"the revelation of the mysteries.\" The instruction the early Christians needed is what we all need, no matter when we were baptized, no matter how much theology we\'ve studied. That\'s because God\'s mysteries are inexhaustible and, until we get to heaven, we\'re all unfinished Christians.  Spirit-Led Mystagogy from the Ancient Masters Now eight of the early Church\'s greatest teachers can be your guides as Living the Mysteries presents the wisdom and insights of: St. Ambrose St. Augustine St. Basil St.  Clement of Alexandria St. Cyril of Jerusalem St. Gregory of Nyssa St. John Chrysostom St. Leo the Great Designed as a devotional - and more - for the fifty days between Easter and Pentecost, Living the Mysteries is a rich spiritual resource aluable any time of the year. Each day features: -A passage from the Church\'s great teachers that focuses on a relevant point of the mystical or moral life -A plan with practical applications for letting that reading inspire your prayer and actions throughout the day You will treasure these timeless lessons on gaining eternal life.  About the authors Scott Hahn and Mike Aquilina are the founders and trustees of the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology and have co-hosted several series on the Eternal Word Television Network. Each has written extensively on Catholic doctrine, history, and devotion.	''	Mystery	''

But while bakery owner Hannah Swensen can provide herself with the confections, cuddling will have to take a back seat to sleuthing when her sometime-squeeze becomes a murder suspect...With the launch party of her mother\'s novel around the corner, Hannah has a dress to fit into and a date with her sister, Andrea, at Lake Eden\'s new health club, Heavenly Bodies. Dragging herself out of bed on a frigid Minnesota morning for exercise, of all things, is bad enough. Discovering a dead body floating in the gym\'s Jacuzzi? Okay, that\'s worse. Nor does it help that there\'s a plate of The Cookie Jar\'s ery own cream puffs garnishing the murder scene. The fact that they were purchased by none other than Hannah\'s part-time flame, Detective Mike Kingston, is simply the icing on what\'s shaping up to be one ery messy cake...Mike may be the prime suspect in the murder of man-eating bombshell Ronni Ward, but he\'s by no means the only one. Ronni, a fitness instructor at both the Sheriff\'s department and Heavenly Bodies, made a nasty habit of throwing her own heavenly body at every man, eligible or not, who crossed her path. Plenty of Lake Eden\'s ladies won\'t miss Ronni, including her ex-fiance\'s former girlfriend, the angry mother of one of her would-be conquests, and even the mayor\'s wife. Could any of them have wanted her gone badly enough to make it happen? Mike\'s recruited Hannah to find out, and, as any suspended, suspected detective would, he\'s micromanaging her every step of the way...Between trying to narrow the list of Ronni\'s enemies down to fewer than half the town\'s female population and resisting the urge to remove Mike from the running by throttling him herself, Hannah has her plate full. Trouble is, when it comes to cookies - and to murder - there\'s always room for one more.	Hannah Swensen Mysteries With Recipes	Mystery	''

Do you simply want to get along and be happy? Or do you desire real intimacy--the kind of relationship that will challenge you to grow as an individual and satisfy you in a much deeper way than you have imagined?  Contrary to what television and bridal magazines tell us, marriage is about much more than personal happiness. Marriage is about spiritual growth. God wants to use your marriage to shape your character and to carry out his purposes in the world through you as a couple.  The book of Genesis provides a matrix for understanding the intimate mystery of marriage in light of three commands--leave (your family of origin), weave (a life together) and cleave (through sexual intimacy). In this book, Dan Allender and Tremper Longman III explore and unpack the rich implications of this pattern.  While this paper edition can be read on its own, a couple, Bible study group or Sunday school class can enhance their understanding by making their way through the bonus six Bible study sessions included in this expanded edition.  Video segments introducing each of the Bible study sessions are also available online for free ideo download, making this book a complete small group curriculum.  The Intimate Mystery is part of the Intimate Marriage Curriculum Kit which includes everything needed to mentor individual married couples or to lead a group discussion and makes an especially helpful resource for newlyweds or young married couples.

The grizzled barkeep\'s social circle was limited to the rough-hewn lobstermen and other assorted toughs that frequented his bar, a derelict main street dive called, appropriately, the Bilge. But when his body is found bobbing in the town\'s icy harbor, Lucy Stone, ace reporter for the Pennysaver newspaper, makes getting to know more about Old Dan a priority. And apparently, there\'s lots to learn.  Like the fact that local musician Dave Reilly insists Old Dan conned a winning lottery ticket worth five grand from him. And that handyman Brian Donohue claims that Old Dan stiffed him for repair work he\'d done at the bar.  There are even whispers about some connection to the Irish Republican Army. The confusion surrounding the death is only compounded by the arrival of actor Dylan Malone, Old Dan\'s brother and a prominent, if fading, attraction of the Dublin stage. Dylan has come to direct the production of Finian\'s Rainbow, the featured event at Our Lady of Hope\'s annual St. Patrick\'s Day extravaganza. He\'s also come to help his brother renovate the Bilge, turning the dingy tavern into an authentic--if decidedly upscale--Irish pub.  Was Old Dan killed by someone he\'d cheated, someone he\'d loved, or someone who just couldn\'t stand the idea of losing their favorite watering hole?

In a career that spans over half a century, her name is synonymous with brilliant deception, ingenious puzzles, and the surprise denouement. By irtually inventing the modern mystery novel she has earned her title as the Queen of Crime. Curious? Then you\'re invited to read...THE SITTAFORD MYSTERYM-U-R-D-E-R. It began as an innocent parlor game intended to while away the hours on a bitter winter night.But the message that appeared before the amateur occultists at the snowbound Sittaford House was spelled out as loud and clear as a scream. Of course, the notion that they had foretold doom was pure bunk. Wasn\'t it? And the discovery of a corpse was pure coincidence. Wasn\'t it?  If they\'re to discover the answer to this baffling murder, perhaps they should play again. But a journey into the spirit world could prove terribly dangerous-especially when the killer is lurking in this one.AUTHORBIO: AGATHA CHRISTIE is the world\'s best known mystery writer. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in 44 foreign languages. She is the most widely published author of all time in any language, outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare. Her writing career spanned more than half a century, during which she wrote 80 novels and short story collections, as well as 14 plays, one of which, The Mousetrap, is the longest-running play in history. Agatha Christie also wrote under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott. As well, she wrote four non-fiction books including an autobiography and an entertaining account of the many expeditions she shared with her archaeologist husband, Sir Max Mallowan. Agatha Christie died in 1976.	St. Martin\'s Minotaur Mysteries	Mystery	''

When Claire and David look out the art room window and see a girl\'s pale face, they suspect it\'s a ghost. How else could someone look into a second floor window and just disappear? As the cousins investigate, they find other peculiar clues: piano music lilting through the halls, the aroma of pumpkin pie, and a crooked old painting that looks like the ghost\'s face. Is their spooky old school house really a haunted house? Each of the six books in this series feature atmospheric spot art throughout. Praise for Kristiana Gregory: \"Through Hattie\'s diary, Gregory brings the rigors of the trip to life, but she also includes the details that kept the settlers going--the friendships and camaraderie that developed and the joyful events (a wedding and some births) that occurred. Gregory brings a sobering dose of reality to an era that\'s often romanticized; this is a fine glimpse of history on a human scale.\"--Kirkus Reviews, for Dear America: Across a Wide and Lonesome Praire \"As she has done in several previous historical novels, Gregory brings to life events and perspectives not often found in the standard history texts... the bloody battles, and the suspenseful tone of the short, cliffhanger chapters will keep most readers involved. Meanwhile, Gregory provides insights into life in Alta California and nicely integrates Spanish words into the text. Historical notes, a glossary, a bibliography, and maps add to this novel\'s utility as a starting point for history lessons as well as for leisure reading.\"--School Library Journal, for The Stowaway. \"This is heartfelt historical fiction, and readers will relish each page of the adventure.\"--Publisher\'s Weekly, for Jenny of the Tetons, winner of the Golden Kite Award and an NCSS-CBC Notable Children\'s Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies.

Over the course of time Olympian luster diminished in favor of religious experiences more immediate to the concerns of people living in an increasingly cosmopolitan ancient world. These experiences were provided by the mysteries, religions that flourished particularly during the Hellenistic period and were secretly practiced by groups of adherents who decided, through personal choice, to be initiated into the profound realities of one deity or another. Unlike the official state religions, in which people were expected to make an outward show of allegiance to the local gods, the mysteries emphasized an inwardness and privacy of worship within a closed band of initiates.
