April 12, 2023:

Here are the files for the bookstore. There are 5. 

authors.tsv
compsci.tsv
mystery.tsv
romance.tsv
scifi.tsv

The authors file is a tab_separated_values. It is pretty simple, the fields are

  Name, aliases, dates (birth/death), general information


The actual books are in the files 

  compsci.tsv, scifi.tsv, romance.tsv, mystery.tsv


These are tab_separated_values. It is pretty simple, the fields are

author, title, price (new), usedprice1, usedprice2, usedprice3, publisher, date, 
  qty_new, qty_used1, qty_used2, qty_used3, language, isbn, isbn13, cover, pages, 
  description, misc

The used prices correspond ot the used quantities. The "price" is the new book
price. There are 3 "covers", hardcover, paperback, audiobook. Used paperbacks
only have two prices and used hardcover have 3. For the audiobooks there are
no used. BUT the fields are ALL THE SAME.

Most of the fields have values, but some may not. You might want to look at the
files before making any really serious decisions about allowing NULLs or
defualts. If there were no values for a field I output \N. After testing, this
is LOADed as NULL. If that is a problem, you might have to figure out a way
around it. 

If there are any questions, ask.

Enjoy.
