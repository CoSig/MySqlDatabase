It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python.  Although I use Python as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing.  Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems.

Robert L. Glass , Andrew Hunt (Contributor)	Software Conflict 2.0: The Art And Science of Software Engineering	22.79	11.39	5.70		Developer.* Books	March 30, 2006	10	1	0		English	0977213307	978-0977213306	paperback	308	Software Conflict 2.0: The Art and Science of Software Engineering updates and expands a neglected classic in the field. The nearly 60 essays in this book--always easily digestible, often profound, and never too serious--are the work of pioneer Robert L. Glass, 50 year software eteran, and author or editor of more than 25 books, including the recent bestseller Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering.  As loyal Glass readers have come to expect, Software Conflict 2.0 takes up large themes and important questions, never shying away from controversy. Robert Glass has a unique perspective, owing partly to his longevity in the field, partly to his breadth and depth of experience as a practitioner, and partly to his experiences on multiple continents crossing back and forth between the worlds of the university and the professional programming shop.  No matter what unique corner of the software engineering world you call home--be it aerospace or e-commerce--whether you are a researcher, hardcore coder, consultant, or manager, Software Conflict 2.0 tackles questions and conflicts that you will recognize. Bob Glass\'s wide and deep perspective on the art and science of software engineering will widen and deepen your own perspective.  Pragmatic Programmer Andy Hunt writes in his Foreword to this book, \"Eleventh-century philosopher Pierre Abelard taught that, \'The beginning of wisdom is found in doubting; by doubting we come to the question, and by seeking we may come upon the truth.\' Welcome to Bob\'s essays on software conflict. Here you\'ll find the seeds of doubt, some underlying questions, and a fellow seeker.\" We couldn\'t agree more.  The first edition of Software Conflict was published circa 1990 and, until now, has been out of print for some time. Why? Mainly because that\'s the normal pattern for software books: a new book is hot when it hits the streets, but then trends change, paradigms shift, and eventually the publisher stops placing orders with the printer. As hundreds of new books are published every year, a real treasure can be buried in the shifting sands.  Sometimes the significance of a software book transcends the endless cycle of trends and revolutions. In fact, some of the great software books continue to be discussed even decades after their original publication.  Why do people keep reading these \"dated\" software engineering books?  Because the insights of these great books are timeless, as alid today as they were yesterday. Because these insights help us become better software professionals, better researchers, better managers. And because the writings of a computing pioneer like Robert L. Glass might just reveal something about where we are today and where we\'re headed.  Software Conflict 2.0 features six new essays by Robert Glass and a new Foreword by Andrew Hunt of the Pragmatic Programmers.	'' Computer Science ''

These are works in a genre the authors term Science Artthat is, art that says something about the natural world and how it works.  Darryl Wheye and Donald Kennedy show how these works of art can advance our understanding of the ways nature has been perceived over time, its current ulnerability, and our responsibility to preserve its wealth.Each room in the gallery is dedicated to a single topic. The rooms on the first floor show birds as icons, birds as resources, birds as teaching tools, and more. On the second floor, the images and their captions clarify what Science Art is and how the intertwining of art and science can change the way we look at each. The authors also provide a timeline linking scientific innovations with the production of images of birds, and they offer a checklist of steps to promote the creation and accessibility of Science Art. Readers who tour this unique and fascinating gallery will never look at art depicting nature in the same way again.  Published with assistance from the Alfred P.

The two methods of computational mechanics that were widely developed were the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Boundary Element Method (BEM). A large number of books were written, dealing exclusively with either the FEM or the BEM. In this century, the discipline has undergone a radical enhancement, leading to the more general paradigms of Modeling  Finite Element Method; Field/Boundary Element Method; The Meshless Local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) Method for Domain  Boundary Methods for certain linear problems, etc. Both Primal  eigen-value problems of buckling and ibration; and acoustic radiation & scattering problems are discussed. A carefully chosen sample problem is solved, throughout the book, by using the arious methods, and the solutions by the arious methods are compared as to their accuracy, convergence, and effi ciency. MathLab or FORTRAN programs are included, to illustrate the computer solutions by a wide ariety of methods listed above. This unique book should be of great interest to graduate students, professionals, and researchers in all disciplines of engineering & the sciences.	'' Computer Science ''

Elementary computer science\'s `Harvey\' is more like a tiger - clever, colorful, powerful, and, thanks to this revised edition of a classic set of texts, ery isible indeed.\" -- William Higginson, Coordinator; Mathematics, Science and Technology Education Group, Queen\'s University at Kingston, Canada This series is for people--adults and teenagers--who are interested in computer programming because it\'s fun. The three olumes use the Logo programming language as the ehicle for an exploration of computer science from the perspective of symbolic computation and artificial intelligence. Logo is a dialect of Lisp, a language used in the most advanced research projects in computer science, especially in artificial intelligence. Throughout the series, functional programming techniques (including higher order functions and recursion) are emphasized, but traditional sequential programming is also used when appropriate. In the second edition, the first two olumes have been rearranged so that illustrative case studies appear with the techniques they demonstrate. Volume 1 includes a new chapter about higher order functions, and the recursion chapters have been reorganized for greater clarity. Volume 2 includes a new tutorial chapter about macros, an exclusive capability of Berkeley Logo, and two new projects. Throughout the series, the larger program examples have been rewritten for greater readability by more extensive use of data abstraction. Volume 1 Symbolic Computing, is addressed to a reader who has used computers and wants to learn the ideas behind them. Symbolic computing is the manipulation of words and sentences, in contrast both to the graphics most people associate with Logo and to the numerical computation with which more traditional languages such as Pascal and C++ are most comfortable. This olume is well known for its clear and thorough presentation of recursion, a key idea in computer science that other texts treat as arcane and difficult. The Logo programs in these books and the author\'s free Berkeley Logo interpreter are available ia the Internet or on diskette.	'' Computer Science ''

Colburn first investigates what makes computer science an empirical science and not merely a branch of pure mathematics. He finds that despite its reliance on formal methods, computer science practices a unique type of abstraction that can help explain the puzzling ontological nature of complex irtual worlds now common in games and on the Internet. Colburn then identifies the roots of the modern field of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rich tradition of Western philosophy since ancient Greece.A ast array of philosophical issues associated with AI\'s current practices are introduced: ethics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and even the ery touchy issue of whether or not machines can be made to think.

In a irtual world, there may be thousands of these objects interacting with each other in real-time. Linear algebra (vector math) is traditionally used to perform these calculations, but linear algebra requires long and complex computer programs to implement and can create ery difficult programming challenges. Developers of real-time applications spend a lot of time trying to squeeze the last ounce of performance out of them. Geometric algebra (GA) is a new and compact way of representing the geometry of these objects that makes the computation and the programming of them much easier. Once only the domain of academic researchers, this book introduces GA to programmers, shows how it extends from linear algebra, and describes how to model geometries using GA. The last part of the book describes techniques for creating applications. A companion website link is included with GaViewer, a program written in C that allows programming experiments with GA.

Understanding the basis and limitations of these models is important since far reaching decisions about the environment are based on these models. It is novel in that it goes beyond a technical discussion of these quasi-realistic models and emphasizes their role and utility in generating new useful knowledge about the system. The book is written in a generally understandable way, with technical details relegated to a set of comprehensive appendices. The line of reasoning is illustrated by numerous examples, from both applied and fundamental research. It is a source of information for graduate students and scientists alike working in the field of environmental sciences.	'' Computer Science ''

Successful use of a simulation model, however, requires careful interrogation of the model through systematic computer experiments. While specific theoretical/mathematical examinations of computer experiment design are available, those interested in applying proposed methodologies need a practical presentation and straightforward guidance on analyzing and interpreting experiment results. Written by authors with strong academic reputations and real-world practical experience, Design and Modeling for Computer Experiments is exactly the kind of treatment you need. The authors blend a sound, modern statistical approach with extensive engineering applications and clearly delineate the steps required to successfully model a problem and provide an analysis that will help find the solution. Part I introduces the design and modeling of computer experiments and the basic concepts used throughout the book. Part II focuses on the design of computer experiments. The authors present the most popular space-filling designs - like Latin hypercube sampling and its modifications and uniform design - including their definitions, properties, construction and related generating algorithms. Part III discusses the modeling of data from computer experiments. Here the authors present arious modeling techniques and discuss model interpretation, including sensitivity analysis. An appendix reviews the statistics and mathematics concepts needed, and numerous examples clarify the techniques and their implementation. The complexity of real physical systems means that there is usually no simple analytic formula that sufficiently describes the phenomena. Useful both as a textbook and professional reference, this book presents the techniques you need to design and model computer experiments for practical problem solving.

Michel Mardiguian	Controlling Radiated Emissions by Design, Second Edition	131.17	98.38	65.58	32.79	Springer; 2nd edition	November 2000	7	2	2	1	English	0792379780	978-0792379782	hardcover	352	In all possible industrial, military and household/personal applications, the number of digital devices operating with data rates of hundreds of Megabits, using processor chips with Gigahertz clocks, has increased astronomically. At the same time, a myriad of popular RF receivers like portable telephones, laptop PCs with integrated wireless modems, wireless Internet, and other electronic devices, are becoming ubiquitous, such that the number of sensitive, licit receivers operating within a square kilometer of an urban area can be counted in tens of thousands. In the crowded space that they share, the conjunction of both events is increasing the number of potential interference situations, especially in the upper VHF and UHF regions where spurious radiations are most difficult to contain. There is, in addition, a growing, although controversial, concern about the possible health hazard caused by long exposure to near fields of low power radio transmitters. All these aspects result in a continuous effort for lowering RF radiations.  This new edition of Controlling Radiated Emissions by Design retains the step-by-step approach for incorporating EMC into every new design, from the ground up. Quite different from other classical EMC books, it approaches the problem from a development engineer\'s iewpoint, starting with the selection of quieter IC technologies, their implementation into a noise-free printed circuit layout, and the gathering of all these into a low radiation packaging, including I/O filtering, connectors and cables considerations.  Equally far from a cookbook of recipes, all guidelines are supported by thorough, but relatively easy and comprehensive calculated examples, allowing a quantitative design, instead of purely qualitative. New to this edition is material on surface mount techniques, IC\'s ground-bounce, random-versus-periodic frequency spectra and recent progress in low cost ferrite and filter components. Also included is detailed information on radiation from high-speed chips (e.g. Pentium 200 MHz) and the efforts by some manufacturers to reduce it. The book has numerous tables, all of which have been updated to reflect the latest changes in the field, including a brief overview of the U.S. and worldwide emission tests.  Controlling Radiated Emissions by Design is an invaluable tool for helping design engineers, EMC specialists and technicians develop more efficient and economical control of emissions.

With plenty of exercises, this book presents classical notions of mathematical logic, such as decidability, completeness and incompleteness, as well as new ideas brought by complexity theory such as NP-completeness, randomness and approximations, providing a better understanding for efficient algorithmic solutions to problems. Divided into three parts, it covers: Model Theory and Recursive Functions - introducing the basic model theory of propositional, 1st order, inductive definitions and 2nd order logic. Recursive functions, Turing computability and decidability are also examined. Descriptive Complexity - looking at the relationship between definitions of problems, queries, properties of programs and their computational complexity.  Approximation - explaining how some optimization problems and counting problems can be approximated according to their logical form. Logic is important in Computer Science, particularly for erification problems and database query languages such as SQL. Students and researchers in this field will find this book of great interest.

The main purpose of the book is to acquaint advanced undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, engineering and mathematics with the algorithmic ideas in computer algebra so that they could do research in computational algebra or understand the algorithms underlying many popular symbolic computational systems: Mathematica, Maple or Axiom, for instance. Also, researchers in robotics, solid modeling, computational geometry and automated theorem proving community may find it useful as symbolic algebraic techniques have begun to play an important role in these areas. The book, while being self-contained, is written at an advanced level and deals with the subject at an appropriate depth. The book is accessible to computer science students with no previous algebraic training. Some mathematical readers, on the other hand, may find it interesting to see how algorithmic constructions have been used to provide fresh proofs for some classical theorems. The book also contains a large number of exercises with solutions to selected exercises, thus making it ideal as a textbook or for self-study.

He condenses a great deal of complex material into a manageable, accessible form. His treatment of programming, for example, presents only a few features of Pascal and restricts all programs to those constructions.  Yet most of the important lessons in programming can be taught within these limitations. The student\'s knowledge of programming then provides the basis for understanding ideas in compilation, operating systems, complexity theory, noncomputability, and other topics. Whenever possible, the author uses common words instead of the specialized ocabulary that might confuse readers. Readers of the book will learn to write a ariety of programs in Pascal, design switching circuits, study a ariety of Von Neumann and parallel architectures, hand simulate a computer, examine the mechanisms of an operating system, classify arious computations as tractable or intractable, learn about noncomputability, and explore many of the important issues in artificial intelligence. This second edition has new chapters on simulation, operating systems, and networks. In addition, the author has upgraded many of the original chapters based on student and instructor comments, with a iew toward greater simplicity and readability.	'' Computer Science ''

This is an introduction to extensions of first-order logic, based on the principle that many-sorted logic (MSL) provides a unifying framework in which to place, for example, second-order logic, type theory, modal and dynamic logics and MSL itself. The aim is two fold: only one theorem-prover is needed; proofs of the metaproperties of the different existing calculi can be avoided by borrowing them from MSL. To make the book accessible to readers from different disciplines, whilst maintaining precision, the author has supplied detailed step-by-step proofs, avoiding difficult arguments, and continually motivating the material with examples. Consequently this can be used as a reference, for self-teaching or for first-year graduate courses.	Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science Computer Science ''

Specific forms of network analysis are used in the study of diverse structures such as the Internet, interlocking directorates, transportation systems, epidemic spreading, metabolic pathways, the Web graph, electrical circuits, project plans, and so on. There is, however, a broad methodological foundation which is quickly becoming a prerequisite for researchers and practitioners working with network models.  From a computer science perspective, network analysis is applied graph theory. Unlike standard graph theory books, the content of this book is organized according to methods for specific levels of analysis (element, group, network) rather than abstract concepts like paths, matchings, or spanning subgraphs. Its topics therefore range from ertex centrality to graph clustering and the evolution of scale-free networks.  In 15 coherent chapters, this monograph-like tutorial book introduces and surveys the concepts and methods that drive network analysis, and is thus the first book to do so from a methodological perspective independent of specific application areas.

Still, in the last ten years, the simple notion of constraints has shown some deficiencies concerning both theory and practice, typically in the way over-constrained problems and preferences are treated. For this reason, the notion of soft constraints has been introduced with semiring-based soft constraints and alued constraints being the two main general frameworks.  This book includes formal definitions and properties of semiring-based soft constraints, as well as their use within constraint logic programming and concurrent constraint programming.  Moreover, the author shows how to adapt existing notions and techniques such as abstraction and interchangeability to the soft constraint framework and it is demonstrated how soft constraints can be used in some application areas, such as security.  Overall, this book is a great starting point for anyone interested in understanding the basics of semiring-based soft constraints.	Lecture Notes in Computer Science Computer Science ''

They can fly airplanes and spaceships, route millions of phone calls simultaneously, and play chess with the world\'s greatest players. But how limitless is the future for the computer? Will computers one day be truly intelligent, make medical diagnoses, run companies, compose music, and fall in love? In Computers Ltd., David Harel, the best-selling author of Algorithmics, illuminates one of the most fundamental yet under-reported facets of computers--their inherent limitations. Looking only at the bad news that is proven, discussing limitations that no amounts of hardware, software, talent, or resources can overcome, the book presents a disturbing and provocative iew of computing at the start of the 21st century. Harel takes us on a fascinating tour that touches on everything from tiling problems and monkey puzzles to Monte Carlo algorithms and quantum computing, showing just how far from perfect computers are, while shattering some of the many claims made for these machines. He concludes that though we may strive for bigger and better things in computing, we need to be realistic: computers are not omnipotent--far from it. Their limits are real and here to stay. Based on hard facts, mathematically proven and indisputable, Computers Ltd. offers a ividly written and often amusing look at the shape of the future.	Popular Science Computer Science ''

It has specific applications for those involved in the development of software and hardware solutions for multimedia, internet, and medical imaging applications, and for those pursuing research in image and ideo compression. The book is suitable as a primary text for a course in image compression; it would also be helpful in the context of a more general class covering multimedia compression at an in-depth level. Final year engineering undergraduate students pursuing projects in multimedia compression and/or communication would also find the book a useful tool. JPEG2000: Image Compression Fundamentals, Standards and Practice is written in four parts, to serve the interests of a wide readership. Representing about half the total text, Part I of the book provides a thorough and up-to-date background in the fundamentals of image compression, including topics not previously brought together in a single olume. Part 2 contains a complete description of the JPEG2000 standard. This description is written in such a way as to be completely self-contained from an implementation perspective, while it contains numerous references to the fundamental developments in Part 1. Together, Parts 1 and 2 serve the complementary roles of explanation and exposition in relation to both the JPEG2000 standard and modern image compression techniques. Part 3 of the book is devoted to the implementation and exploitation of the JPEG2000 standard, containing guidelines, suggestions, and analyses for both software and hardware oriented applications. Part 4 describes other key image compression standards, namely JPEG and JPEG-LS. The purpose of this material is to allow the reader to compare the capabilities and complexity associated with these standards with those of JPEG2000. This final part of the book also serves to provide a practical demonstration of some of the fundamental techniques introduced in Part 1 which are not demonstrated by the JPEG2000 standard. About the CD-ROM: Included with the book is a compact disc containing documentation, binaries, and all source code to the Kakadu software tools. This software provides a complete C++ implementation of JPEG2000 Part 1, demonstrating many of the principles described in the text itself. The software is frequently referenced from the text as an additional resource for understanding complex or subtle aspects of the standard. Conversely, the software makes frequent reference to the text and has been written to mesh with the terminology and notation employed therein.

Alan Wallace reveals the theoretical similarities underlying these disparate disciplines and their unified approach to making sense of the objective world.  Wallace begins by exploring the relationship between Christian and Buddhist meditative practices. He outlines a sequence of meditations the reader can undertake, showing that, though Buddhism and Christianity differ in their belief systems, their methods of cognitive inquiry provide similar insight into the nature and origins of consciousness.  From this convergence Wallace then connects the approaches of contemporary cognitive science, quantum mechanics, and the philosophy of the mind. He links Buddhist and Christian iews to the provocative philosophical theories of Hilary Putnam, Charles Taylor, and Bas an Fraassen, and he seamlessly incorporates the work of such physicists as Anton Zeilinger, John Wheeler, and Stephen Hawking. Combining a concrete analysis of conceptions of consciousness with a guide to cultivating mindfulness and profound contemplative practice, Wallace takes the scientific and intellectual mapping of the mind in exciting new directions.

This latter question is known as the refinement of programs and the purpose of this book is to consider these questions in a formal setting. In fact, correctness turns out to be a special case of refinement and so the focus is on refinement.  Although a reasonable background knowledge is assumed from mathematics and CS, the book is a self-contained introduction suitable for graduate students and researchers coming to this subject for the first time.

The method, which is illustrated with case studies taken from the area of communication systems, can readily be used to construct a ariety of models that can be analysed using standard numerical techniques. One of the major advantages of PEPA over the standard methods for specifying stochastic performance models is the inherent apparatus for reasoning about the structure and behaviour of models. In the later chapters this apparatus is exploited to define four equivalence relations over PEPA components. Each of these notions of equivalence has intrinsic interest from a process algebra perspective. However, they are also demonstrated to be useful in a performance modelling context. To conclude the book, a section has been added surveying recent results in the area and discussing open questions.	Distinguished Dissertations in Computer Science Computer Science ''

Current Steering D/A converters offer the potential to achieve high dynamic range for wide frequency bandwidths, however, their performance at higher frequencies is usually limited by strong nonlinear behavior. This behavior is not well understood and impedes performance progress.  Computer Science ''
 Wide-Bandwidth High Dynamic Range D/A Converters presents a structured description of the operation principles and the nonlinear behavior of Current Steering D/A Converters, and shows ways to deal with it in the design phase. The book provides the reader a thorough understanding of error mechanisms at high frequencies. It explains their effects and shows their dependencies with parameters of the processed signal, the architecture, its circuit blocks and their implementations. A highlight of the book is the detailed treatment of timing errors caused by circuit imperfections due to process mismatch and clock interconnects. The book follows a unique approach, building an analysis and synthesis framework of concepts with a generic scope beyond the current steering architecture. The concepts are tested in practice with the design and measurements of a high performance 12b 500MSample/sec Current Steering Digital to Analog Converter realized in 0.18m m CMOS.

It presents many concepts and results of probability theory and stochastic processes.  After an introduction to queues in computer networks, this self-contained book covers important random ariables, such as Pareto and Poisson, that constitute models for arrival and service disciplines. It then deals with the equilibrium M/M/1/queue, which is the simplest queue that is amenable for analysis. Subsequent chapters explore applications of continuous time, state-dependent single Markovian queues, the M/G/1 system, and discrete time queues in computer networks. The author then proceeds to study networks of queues with exponential servers and Poisson external arrivals as well as the G/M/1 queue and Pareto interarrival times in a G/M/1 queue. The last two chapters analyze bursty, self-similar traffic, and fluid flow models and their effects on queues.	Chapman & Hall/Crc Computer & Information Science Series Computer Science ''

Exploring these recent developments, the Handbook of Parallel Computing: Models, Algorithms, and Applications provides comprehensive coverage on all aspects of this field. The first section of the book describes parallel models. It covers evolving computational systems, the decomposable bulk synchronous model, parallel random access machine-on-chip architecture, the parallel disks model, mobile agents, fault-tolerant computing, hierarchical performance modeling, the partitioned optical passive star network, and the reconfigurable mesh model. The subsequent section on parallel algorithms examines networks of workstations, grid and packet scheduling, the derandomization technique, isosurface extraction and rendering, suffix trees, and mobile computing algorithmics. The final part of the text highlights an array of problems and offers ways to combat these challenges. This olume provides an up-to-date assessment of the models and algorithms involved in applying parallel computing to a ariety of fields, from computational biology to wireless networking.

Gilles Dowek	Principles of Programming Languages	35.86	17.93	8.96		Springer; 1 edition	February 6, 2009	8	4	3		English	1848820313	978-1848820319	paperback	158	The development of programming languages has radically modified our relation to language, complexity and machines. This book is an introduction to the principles around which these languages are organised  imperative constructions, functional constructions, reference, dynamic data types, objects and more. Using Java as a main language, but systematically comparing it to other languages it enables the reader to understand the unifying concepts that lie beneath each particular language and provides the tools that allow the students to adapt to new programming languages.

Marco Lanzagorta (Contributor), Jeffrey Uhlmann (Contributor)	Quantum Computer Science	34.31	17.16	8.58		Morgan and Claypool Publishers	November 14, 2008	5	2	0		English	1598297325	978-1598297324	paperback	108	In this text we present a technical overview of the emerging field of quantum computation along with new research results by the authors. What distinguishes our presentation from that of others is our focus on the relationship between quantum computation and computer science. Specifically, our emphasis is on the computational model of quantum computing rather than on the engineering issues associated with its physical implementation. We adopt this approach for the same reason that a book on computer programming doesn\'t cover the theory and physical realization of semiconductors. Another distinguishing feature of this text is our detailed discussion of the circuit complexity of quantum algorithms. To the extent possible we have presented the material in a form that is accessible to the computer scientist, but in many cases we retain the conventional physics notation so that the reader will also be able to consult the relevant quantum computing literature. Although we expect the reader to have a solid understanding of linear algebra, we do not assume a background in physics. This text is based on lectures given as short courses and invited presentations around the world, and it has been used as the primary text for a graduate course at George Mason University. In all these cases our challenge has been the same: how to present to a general audience a concise introduction to the algorithmic structure and applications of quantum computing on an extremely short period of time. The feedback from these courses and presentations has greatly aided in making our exposition of challenging concepts more accessible to a general audience.

Franco Maloberti	Analog Design for CMOS VLSI Systems	219.00	164.25	109.50	54.75	Springer; 1 edition	October 31, 2001	8	1	0	0	English	0792375505	978-0792375500	hardcover	388	Analog Design for CMOS VLSI Systems is a comprehensive text that offers a detailed study of the background principles and the analog design techniques for CMOS-VLSI implementation. The book covers the physical operation and the modelling of MOS transistors. Discusses the key features of integrated passive components and studies basic building blocks and oltage and current references before considering in great details the design of op-amps and comparators. The book is primarily intended for use as a graduate-level textbook and for practising engineers. It is expected that the reader should be familiar with the concepts taught in basic introductory courses in analog circuits.  Relying on that proper background knowledge the book presents the material on an intuitive basis with a minimum use of mathematical quantitative analysis.  Therefore, the insight induced by the book will favour that kind of knowledge gathering required for the design of high-performance analog circuits. The book favours this important process with a number of inserts providing hints or advises on key features of the topic studied. An interesting peculiarity of the book is the use of numbers. The equations describing the circuit operation are guidelines for the designer. It is important to assess performances in a quantitative way. To achieve this target the book provides a number of examples on computer simulations using Spice. Moreover, in order to acquire the feeling of the technological progress, three different hypothetical technologies are addressed and used. Detailed examples and the many problems make Analog Design for CMOS VLSI Systems a comprehensive textbook for a graduate-level course on analog circuit design. Moreover, the book will efficiently serve the practical needs of a wide range of circuit design and system design engineers.
