Yet to this day, its true nature remains one of science\'s greatest mysteries. But what if dark matter actually is just ordinary matter purposely hidden from our iew? What if we are only allowed to see a small fraction of the stars in every galaxy, because the ast majority of star systems in our own galaxy are teeming with aliens who wish to remain unseen? Marc Zemin, a brilliant student of astrophysics, is the first human to ever stumble upon this startling secret, when his experiments with wormhole travel cause aliens to land on Earth and whisk him away into space. To his astonishment, the aliens want his help in fighting a colossal interstellar war that is rapidly spiraling out of control. But as he struggles to survive from battle to battle across the farthest reaches of the galaxy, he begins to uncover a horrifying conspiracy at play, striving to keep the different sides in continuous conflict with each other. A desperate race against time ensues, as he and a handful of newfound alien friends try to stop the war and confront this mysterious, powerful force bent on destroying all life in the galaxy. But any hope of their success surprisingly appears to hinge on just one thing - whether or not Marc has the strength to overcome his own demons and face the shattering truth about who he really is. \"A sci-fi debut that shows great potential.\" - Kirkus Discoveries	'' Science Fiction

Outnumbered and outgunned, The Interstellar Defense League cannot afford to discard any asset -- so a disgraced Sector Commander is being given a chance to redeem himself ... by sacrificing his life.  The fate of Christoph Stone -- and, perhaps, the destiny of all humankind -- is to be decided on a distant frontier planet nestled deep in enemy-controlled space. Saddled with shockingly green troops, a captain with a checkered past, and a trouble-making civilian expeditionary force, Stone\'s mission is clear and clearly suicidal. Because even his superiors are unaware of the weapon the Remor have waiting for the human invaders as they attempt to retake a captive world: an instrument of destruction that is demonic, unstoppable ... and obscenely human.

Concentrating on literary SF and (in the later chapters) cinema and TV, it also discusses the myriad forms this genre takes in the contemporary world, including a chapter on graphic novels, SF pop music, isual art and ufology. The author is ideally placed to write it: both an academic literary critic and also an acclaimed creative writer of science fiction, with five novels and many short stories to his credit. Written in lively, accessible prose, this study is specifically designed to bridge the worlds of academic criticism and the SF fandom.The History of Science Fiction argues that, even today, this flourishing cultural idiom is shaped by the forces that determined its rise to prominence in the 1600s: the dialogue between Protestant and Catholic worldviews, the emerging technologies of the industrial age, and the cultural anxieties and excitements of a rapidly changing world. Now available in paperback, it will be of interest to all students, researchers and fans of SF.	Palgrave Histories of Literature Science Fiction

Wells, Robin Wood, Philip K. Dick, George F. Will, and Pauline Kael.  Ranging from 1907 to 2004, half the essays are new, and many of the older pieces have been reprinted only once since original publication. Commentaries by Georges Mlis, a French magician and the father of the special effects film, and the author H.G. Wells, who denounces as unscientific the now classic Metropolis, published in 1907 and 1927, respectively, amount to rediscoveries.  THE SCIENCE FICTION FILM READER is broken down into these categories: Foundations, Adventures in Outer Space, The 1950s, Imagining Disaster, The 1960s, Kubrick and Others, Star Wars, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, The Films of Philip K. Dick, Cyborg Cinema, Travels in Time and Place, and Gods and Aliens. Unlike most readers, it offers a broad range of political iews from liberal humanists, Marxists, libertarians, Catholics, feminists and conservatives.  Editor Gregg Rickman branches out from the circumscribed academic routine to include work from current journalists and respected critics (J. Hoberman of the Village Voice and Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader ); filmmakers (Joe Dante and Michael Lennick); authors (Arthur C. Clarke and Anthony Burgess, both commenting on their works\' adaptations into films by Stanley Kubrick); and celebrated science fiction illustrator, Vincent di Fate. Academic contributors include the well-known Robin Wood; Slavoj Zizek, famous in both the academy and psychoanalysis and the subject of a 2003 New Yorker profile; and the up and coming film historians Hassan Melehy, Carina Dielissen, Keith Hamel and Laura Rascaroli.  Interviews with 1950s filmmakers Robert Wise and Don Siegel, the sublime Joseph Campbell, Steven Spielberg (sanguine immediately following his success with E.T.) and Philip K. Dick have only been printed once or twice before this anthology.	'' Science Fiction

Clarke\'s 2001, science fiction has emerged as a mode of thinking, complementary to the scientific method. Science fiction\'s field of interest is the gap between the new worlds uncovered by experimentation and exploration, and the fantastic worlds of the imagination. Its proponents find drama in the tension between the familiar and the unfamiliar. Its readers, many of them scientists and politicians, find inspiration in the contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary.

By imagining future worlds that defy our most basic assumptions about sex and gender, freedom and equality, and ethical alues, the anthology\'s authors not only challenge traditional standards of morality and justice, but create bold experiments for testing feminist hypotheses.  Selections are grouped under four main themes. Part 1, \"Human Nature and Reality,\" concentrates on whether there is an intrinsic difference between males and females. Here the authors inspect opposing iews on five related questions: What does it mean to be human? What are women and men really like? How significant is the reproductive difference? How do we define the concepts of \"woman\" and \"nature\"? Why is language important?  Part 2, \"Dystopias: The Worst of All Possible Worlds,\" first portrays misogynistic societies uncomfortably familiar to the early 21st-century reader. Chilling stories of future possibilities follow, including worlds where women and men separate into armies to fight a literal war of the sexes.  Part 3, \"Separatist Utopias: Worlds of Difference,\" assembles stories that scrutinize both the irtues and ices of separatism, in order to address the questions Why should women want to separate from men? and What would and should these all-female worlds be like?  In Part 4, \"Androgynous Utopias: Worlds of Equality,\" the authors create intriguing worlds that anticipate the consequences, good and bad, of perfect sexual equality in education, intelligence, capability, and reproduction.  With selections from such noted writers as Margaret Atwood, Octavia Butler, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Karen Joy Fowler, Ursula K. Le Guin, James Tiptree Jr., and many others, plus chapter introductions, discussion questions, and recommended reading list, this stimulating collection offers fresh insights on troubling issues by weaving controversial utopian and dystopian designs from the separate threads of opposing positions.

The book is well-illustrated, contains over 446 graphs and illustrations, copies of ancient manuscripts, and countless facts attesting to the falsity of the chronology used nowadays, which never cease to amaze the reader. Eminent mathematician proves that: Jesus Christ was born in 1153 and crucified in 1186 The Old Testament refers to mediaeval events. Apocalypse was written after 1486. Does this sound uncanny? This ersion of events is substantiated by hard facts and logic - alidated by new astronomical research and statistical analysis of ancient sources - to a greater extent than everything you may have read and heard about history before. The dominating historical discourse in its current state was essentially crafted in the XVI century from a rather contradictory jumble of sources such as innumerable copies of ancient Latin and Greek manuscripts whose originals had anished in the Dark Ages and the allegedly irrefutable proof offered by late mediaeval astronomers, resting upon the power of ecclesial authorities. Nearly all of its components are blatantly untrue! For some of us, it shall possibly be quite disturbing to see the magnificent edifice of classical history to turn into an ominous simulacrum brooding over the snake pit of mediaeval politics.  Twice so, in fact: the first seeing the legendary millenarian dust on the ancient marble turn into a mere layer of dirt - one that meticulous unprejudiced research can eventually remove. The second, and greater, attack of unease comes with the awareness of just how many areas of human knowledge still trust the three elephants of the consensual chronology to support them. Nothing can remedy that except for an individual chronological revolution happening in the minds of a large enough number of people.	'' Science Fiction

Thomas Moylan , Tom Moylan	Scraps of the Untainted Sky: Science Fiction, Utopia, Dystopia	33.00	16.50	8.25		Westview Press	December 1, 2000	9	3	0		English	0813397685	978-0813397689	paperback	350	A cultural studies examination of the twentieth century genre of dystopian fiction in the political and scholarly context of the evolution of science fiction studies and utopian studies since the 1960s. Focuses especially on the \"critical dystopias\" of the 1980s and 1990s and examines their interrogation of the sociopolitical and cultural changes wrought by capitalist restructuring and neo-conservative and neo-liberal governments in the United States and Europe.  In Scraps of the Untainted Sky, Tom Moylan offers a thorough investigation of the history and aesthetics of dystopia. To situate his study, he sets out the methodological paradigm that developed within the interdisciplinary fields of science fiction studies and utopian studies as they grow out of the oppositional political culture of the 1960s and 1970s (the context of that produced the project of cultural studies itself). He then presents a thorough account of the textual structure and formal operations of the dystopian text. From there, he focuses on the new science fictional dystopias that emerged in the context of the economic, political, and cultural convulsions of the 1980s and 1990s, and he examines in detail three of these new \"critical dystopias:\" Kim Stanley Robinson\'s The Gold Coast, Octavia Butler\'s The Parable of the Sower , and Marge Piercy\'s He, She, and It .  Dystopian narrative is a product of the social ferment of the twentieth century. A hundred years of war, famine, disease, state terror, genocide, ecocide, and the depletion of humanity through the buying and selling of everyday life provided fertile ground for this fictive underside of the utopian imagination. From the classical works by E. M. Forster, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, and Margaret Atwood, through the new maps of hell in postwar science fiction, and most recently in the dystopian turn of the 1980s and 1990s, this narrative machine has produced challenging cognitive maps of the given historical situation by way of imaginary societies which are even worse than those that lie outside their authors\' and readers\' doors.

In this collection of sixteen stories, he explores such wide-ranging contemporary themes as galvanism, time travel and resurrection of the dead. \"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfall\" relates a man\'s balloon journey to the moon with a combination of scientific precision and astonishing fantasy. Elsewhere, the boundaries between horror and science are elegantly blurred in stories such as \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\", while the great essay \"Eureka\" outlines Poe\'s own interpretation of the universe. Powerfully influential on later authors including Jules Verne, these works are essential reading for anyone wishing to trace the genealogy of science fiction, or to understand the complexity of Poe\'s own creative ision.

May 31, 2005	10	8	1		English	0595348440	978-0595348442	paperback	214	Twelve-Furlong Mile and Other Works of Short Fiction is a aried and unique collection of ten stories built upon likable, easy-to-relate-to characters that stray from their comfortable, everyday surroundings and find themselves in situations filled with humor, romance, and conflict.  In the short story \"Twelve-Furlong Mile,\" two young men take their annual trip to Las Vegas, eager to escape the rigors of their daily lives. The \"End of Latency\" and \"Summer Trade\" are science fiction tales, refreshing in their approach to the genre. \"Ken and the Princess\" and \"Friendly Wager\" are about the pursuit of true love--obtainable--but always at a price. \"The Adventures of Dan Wetmeyerbent\" is a story about the trials of an eighth-grader assigned to write a column for his school newspaper. Perhaps the most touching story, \"The Wingman,\" brings a whole new perspective to the fabled, trusty sidekick designation for one man at an out-of-town work seminar.  The stories--and their surprise endings--are a reflection of the author Steve Scott\'s appreciation for the original television show, The Twilight Zone. The twisting plot lines, while always believable, will, at the same time, bowl you over.	'' Science Fiction

Look to science fiction master Kim Stanley Robinson for fascinating ideas; then turn to historian Carl Abbott for further insights. Science Fiction
 Over the last half-century, science fiction has witnessed increasing complexity in its treatments of future homesteading, community building, mining, and other themes familiar to western historians. Considering these common threads, this is the first book to explore the ways that science fiction writers have drawn directly on narratives of the American West to frame their isions of the future. Abbott offers a fruitful new way to read science fiction, one that also greatly enriches our understanding of western history and its impact on our collective imagination. Detailing the overlap of science fiction and western fiction-especially relating to their mutual interest in and concerns about frontier expansionism-he reveals an unsuspected common ground that informs the writings of both camps. Reviewing the work of many Hugo and Nebula Award winners, as well as drawing upon popular film and television series (like the Buck Rogers serials), Abbott\'s study journeys across the far reaches of science fiction\'s universe. His cast of notables ranges from enerable masters like Robert Heinlein and Fritz Lieber to new-wave feminist Ursula Le Guin and cyberpunk pioneer William Gibson; their settings are as diverse as the near-future West of Octavia Butler and the entrancing extraterrestrial isions of Pamela Sargent, Jonathan Lethem, and C. J. Cherryh. Both enlightening and energizing, Abbott\'s study deftly shows us how the ways we remember the past greatly influence our ability to imagine multiple futures-in distant universes that appear ery strange and yet utterly familiar. Frontiers Past and Future boldly goes where no historian has gone before and rewards us with new insights into our probable pasts and possible futures.	'' Science Fiction

Hassler and Clyde Wilcox have brought together twenty-four noted international scholars representing diverse fields of inquiry to assess more recent influential oices and trends in New Boundaries in Political Science Fiction. The terrors and technologies that permeate our daily lives have changed radically in the past decade, highlighting the underlying speculations on our contested future at the core of this genre. Surveying the ast expanse of recent political science fiction, the editors posit that the defining dilemma for these tales rests in whether identity and meaning germinate from linear progressions or from a continuous return to the primitive realities of war, death, and competition for survival.  The collection\'s first section focuses on issues inherent in fiction of personal identity and the new man. From neuroscience to blogs to the polemic on gender and race, this section investigates democratization of political elements that lead to genuine new identities. The subsequent section explores works that evoke the old power centers of empires and nation states, where larger-than-life heroic systems represent a nostalgic symbol for triumphant human advancement. The final section presents idiosyncratic essays on individual writers and concludes with a comic treatment of America\'s current situation in international politics as iewed through a science fiction lens.  The writers discussed range from H. G. Wells, Robert A.  Heinlein, Ursula Le Guin, and Isaac Asimo to more radical oices such as Iain M.  Banks, William Gibson, Joanna Russ, Philip K. Dick, and China Mieville. While emphasizing the literature, the collection also addresses political science fiction found on film and television from the original Star Trek through the newest incarnation of Battlestar Galactica.

Chronology 2` is the second olume of the most explosive and astounding tractate on history ever written - however, every theory it contains, no matter how unorthodox, is backed by rock solid scientific data. The book is easy and pleasant to read; it is well-illustrated, contains hundreds of charts, graphs and illustrations, copies of ancient manuscripts, and countless facts attesting to the falsity of the chronology used nowadays. You will be amazed to discover: - That the chronology universally accepted today and taken for granted is simply wrong; - That ALL methods of dating of ancient sources and artefacts known today are erroneous or non-exact; - That there is not a single document that could be reliably dated earlier than the XIth century; The Author refers to the Middle Ages as the \"Antiquity\" and proves mutual superimposition of the Second and the Third Roman Empire, both of which become identified as the respective kingdoms of Israel and Judah.  Furthermore, he asserts that the famous reform of the Occidental Church in the XI century by \"Pope Gregory Hildebrand\" was the reflection of the XII century reforms of Byzantine emperor Andronicus who in his turn identifies with Jesus Christ.

Nearly all scholars and critics of early science fiction acknowledge that colonialism is an important and relevant part of its historical context, and recent scholarship has emphasized imperialism\'s impact on late Victorian Gothic and adventure fiction and on Anglo-American popular and literary culture in general. John Rieder argues that colonial history and ideology are crucial components of science fiction\'s displaced references to history and its engagement in ideological production. He proposes that the profound ambivalence that pervades colonial accounts of the exotic \"other\" establishes the basic texture of much science fiction, in particular its acillation between fantasies of discovery and isions of disaster. Combining original scholarship and theoretical sophistication with a clearly written presentation suitable for students as well as professional scholars, this study offers new and innovative readings of both acknowledged classics and rediscovered gems.

This led to his current position as a Religious Research specialist for the Mutual UFO Network since 1996. He is also a member of the alumni at Central Bible College and was ordained by the Independent Assemblies of God in 1980. An avid reader, Jim is experienced and comfortable with studying the Bible in its original languages and spending hours in research as a hobby.  Originally from Detroit Michigan, Jim founded and served in one of the nation\'s first evangelical Christian Motorcycle clubs in the early 70\'s which appeared on the 700 club. Jim served as Pastor in the inner city of Detroit working within the counter cultures associated with drugs and gangs. He has had almost 30 years experience working in deliverance ministries engaged in spiritual warfare that have enabled many to be set free from these bondages. Taking this experience with him into the investigation of UFOs and Alien abductions, Jim has become actively involved within the UFO community. With two other colleagues, The Alien Abduction Crises Centers of America was founded. This is a nation-wide network to provide Biblical based support and help for abductees after receiving terminations of their abduction experiences from the Biblical based counseling they provide as a free service. Jim has also traveled across the US providing Biblical based information at UFO conventions which led to setting up a book store/ museum in Roswell NM where he lived for four years. This book is the result of over ten years intensive first hand investigation and study of the subject and the people involved. It promises to be one of the most comprehensive scripturally backed books written so far, that weaves many different topics into one story of Paradise lost and found. Not since the great flood of Noah has there been such an elaborate deception put upon mankind. This book exposes it all for your consideration. Unlike many sensational books that leave you left in fear and hopelessness, this book will leave you with hope and answers for the fearful things described and soon to fall upon an unsuspecting planet.

The galaxy is at war. The Confederation of Humanity is a democracy fracturing under the strain of nearly a century of war with alien invaders, the warriors of the Kreelan Empire.  Humanoids with blue skin, fangs and fingers that end in razor sharp talons, they have technology that is millennia beyond that of the Confederation, yet they seek out close combat with sword and claw, fighting and dying to honor their god-like Empress. For the Confederation, there is no negotiation, there is no surrender. There is only the fierce struggle to survive. On an embattled world, young Reza Gard finds himself face to face with Tesh-Dar, the greatest of the Empires warriors. Born to a race whose recorded history spans half a million years, Tesh-Dar - a warrior priestess - is endowed with powers that are supernatural to human eyes. In Rezas eyes, the eyes of a boy whose parents she has just slain, she is a monster. Holding him off the ground, face to face, she is slowly strangling him when he lashes out with his dead fathers knife, cutting her face across the left eye. Surprised and impressed with this young human animal, she bestows upon him a matching wound, a trophy of sorts, and inexplicably lets him live. Orphaned and alone, Reza is sent to the planet Hallmark. Supposedly a safe haven for war orphans, in reality it is little more than a slave labor planet. Toiling in grain fields under a burning sun, Reza leads a ragtag band of orphans doing the best they can to survive. But again, Tesh-Dar intervenes in his life. Leading an attack against Hallmark, she has been sent by her Empress on a special mission: to gather human children and return them to the Empire as part of an experiment to see if they have souls.  Reza, along with thousands of others, is captured, with Hallmark left behind in flaming ruin. He awakens to the silver-flecked feline eyes of Esah-Zhurah, a young warrior tasked with teaching him the language and customs of her people.  At first beaten and caged, Reza gradually earns her grudging respect. Over the years that follow he not only survives, but thrives as he learns the warrior ways of the Empire, becoming both more and less than human. As the relationship between the two young warriors deepens, Tesh-Dar and the Empress wonder if Reza may be the One foretold in an ancient prophecy, who will redeem the Kreelan race from an ancient blood curse. As Rezas final challenge looms, Esah-Zhurah performs an ancient blood ritual that binds them together in body and spirit.  For the first time the Bloodsong, the tie that binds every Kreelan soul to the Empress, echoes in his eins, at last making him one with the Children of the Empress. But his acceptance of the Kreelan Way leaves him with a dreadful choice: he must either make war against the humans, or - if he refuses - leave the Empire and Esah-Zhurah behind forever. The path he takes leads him toward a destiny set in motion millennia before, with the fate of both races hanging in the balance...	'' Science Fiction

Taking as a starting point the popularity of international forms such as Japanese Manga and Hong Kong sci-fi, in addition to the success of films such as The Matrix and television series such as Deep Space Nine, the contributors examine the science fiction genre as an international, populist form of social analysis. In doing so, they discuss issues such as Orientalism, technology, apocalyptic futures, xenophobia, militarism and the role of women. Most contemporary studies look at the generic characteristics of science fiction,with its allegorical rendering of contemporary life, usually in relation to America. This book moves beyond a purely generic study, assessing European and Asian film work, discussing their arying representations of the Other, and what this reveals about popular perceptions of global culture and society. Case studies include Independence Day, Star Trek: First Contact and Until the End of the World, in addition to chapters on Eco-Apocalypse and new French sci-fi and New Manchester Ecstasy sci-fi.

Serenity was the wildly successful follow-up to the series. Here is a definitive guide to the series and the movie, offering an in-depth and comprehensive look at the TV phenomenon kept alive by the fans.  The brain child of Joss Whedon--of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel fame--Firefly ran for twelve hour-long episodes before being cancelled by the network. But this premature burial had a remarkable outcome: resurrection. The fans--self-named Browncoats--kept multiplying, the DVDs kept selling and the show forged a new life on the internet, sustained by blogs, fan-fics and podcasts.

Roy Kinnard	Science Fiction Serials: A Critical Filmography of the 31 Hard SF Cliffhangers	35.00	17.50	8.75		McFarland	February 11, 2008	2	1	0		English	0786437456	978-0786437450	paperback	223	Destination Moon; George Pal\'s 1950 Technicolor epic, is generally cited as the first noteworthy science fiction film. Usually ignored or casually dismissed in genre histories are the serials, the low-budget chapterplays exhibited as Saturday matinee fare and targeted almost exclusively at children.  Lacking stars and top-notch writers or directors, the serials went largely unnoticed and unacknowledged by either critics or by the film industry. Yet serials were financially important to the Hollywood studios, and were often free to exploit risky or outlandish subjects that producers of distinguished movies would not touch. Influential serials such as The Phantom Empire (1935) and Flash Gordon (1936) finally brought science fiction themes to the big screen. Those serials and 29 others are exhaustively covered in this work, which provides complete cast and credit information along with plot descriptions and historical commentary for each serial. Video distributors (if available) are also listed.	'' Science Fiction
H.G. Wells	The Time Machine	8.95	4.47	2.24		Coffeetown Press	March 26, 2008	8	2	1		English	160381003X	978-1603810036	paperback	134	H.G. Wells\'s classic novel The Time Machine, first published in 1895, is one part fairy tale, one part love story, one part science fiction, and one part utopia. Readers can enjoy the story on multiple levels and take away something unique to themselves upon finishing the novel. With every turn of the page, we become as little children being read a good night story; for in effect, we are being read to rather than reading ourselves.  The story is told through an unnamed narrator, a young member of an informal group of men who meet occasionally at the Time Traveler\'s house for dinner, drinks, cigars, and conversation. It is no accident that the narrator who tells us the story is the least skeptical, indeed the most credulous of the group, in response to the Time Traveler\'s claim to have built a Time Machine. We need an optimistic and trusting narrator, for he represents the audacity of hope, the possibility of human endeavor leading to improvement and progress, at a time when the specter of social Darwinism and scientific fatalism had fallen over the western world.  The narrator is the one who exclaims, in response to the prospect of traveling into the future, \"To discover a society erected on a strictly communistic basis.\" As humorous and nave as such a statement sounds to us today, communism was a synonym for utopia in the late nineteenth century. And so we are supposed to identify with the narrator, to suspend our disbelief in the absurd hypothesis of time as the fourth dimension and the fantastical invention of a time machine.  During the time when we submit to the power of the story and allow ourselves to be swept away by the fantasy, time machine does exist and time travel is possible.	'' Science Fiction

Lincoln Geraghty	American Science Fiction Film and Television	24.95	12.47	6.24		Berg Publishers	December 8, 2009	12	7	2		English	1845207963	978-1845207960	paperback	192	\"American Science Fiction Film and Television\" presents a critical history of late 20th Century SF together with an analysis of the cultural and thematic concerns of this popular genre. Science fiction film and television were initially inspired by the classic literature of HG Wells and Jules Verne.  The potential and fears born with the Atomic age fuelled the popularity of the genre, upping the stakes for both technology and apocalypse. From the Cold War through to America\'s current War on Terror, science fiction has proved a subtle ehicle for the hopes, fears and preoccupations of a nation at war. The definitive introduction to American science fiction, this is also the first study to analyse SF across both film and TV. Throughout, the discussion is illustrated with critical case studies of key films and television series, including \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", \"Planet of the Apes\", \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\", \"The X-Files\", and \"Battlestar Galactica\".

Ivan Yefremov , Strugatsky Arkady	The Heart of the Serpent: Soviet Science Fiction	24.95	12.47	6.24		Fredonia Books	September 30, 2002	12	4	0		English	1410100413	978-1410100412	paperback	272	Professor Ivan Yefremo (born 1907) is well known both as a tireless fossil hunter and a talented science-fiction writer. His fantasy ranges between the mysteries of times long bygone and the distant future. His novels include The Land of Foam, where the scene is set in ancient Egypt and Greece, and the world-renowned Andromeda, in which his fantasy roams two thousand years ahead. The Heart of the Serpent, given in this olume, was written in 1959. Its subject is related to that of Andromeda.  Anatoly Dniepro (born 1919), the author of Siema, which he wrote in 1958, is a distinguished physicist who works at an institute of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences. His first book appeared in 1946. His favorite subject is cybernetics - its amazing achievements to date and its breathtaking potentialities. Scientific authenticity is a salient feature of his writings.  Victor Separin (born 1905), a journalist by profession, is editor of the Soviet popular geographic magazine Around the World. His fiction, which treats of present-day scientific and technical problems, is amazingly realistic.  In this olume he is represented by The Trial of Tantalus, a story dealing with prospects of microbiology.  Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, authors of The Six Matches, are frequent contributors to Soviet popular science periodicals. Few readers know, however, that the two brothers are not professional writers. Boris Strugatsky (born 1933) is an astronomer and works at the computer laboratory of Pulknovo Observatory. Arkady (born 1925) is a linguist and translator specializing in Japanese.  Valentina Zhuravleva (born 1933) is a comparatively recent graduate of the Azerbaijan Medical Institute. She was probably prompted to try her hand at scientific fiction by the almost fantastic possibilities offering in the field of medicine. The bold flights of fancy in her scientific thinking make her stories particularly noteworthy. Bio-automation is the theme of her Stone from the Stars, written in 1959, and included in this olume.

This book considers how imaginative works involving time travel reflect ongoing scientific concerns and examine the human condition. The scope of the olume is unusually wide, covering such topics as Dante, the major novels of the 19th century, and stories and films of the 1990s. The book concludes with a lengthy bibliography of short stories and novels, films and television programs, and nonfiction works that feature time travel or speculations about time.
