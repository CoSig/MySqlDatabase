While the enticing action and bloodletting remains, this debut novel takes a smart look at the undead--their legions and their way of life.

Vampires have a method, and even in a modern day London, the undead still have a high prince who ubiquitously rules over all the creatures of the night just as he has for centuries. Jin is the most recent prince due to be crowned; he has been groomed for an entire lifetime. Poised to take his rightful place, a dissenting tribe tries to assassinate him and if it wasn\'t for the unwitting energies of a compassionate stranger--an American woman named Adina Carr--the tribe would have succeeded. What follows is an erotic and mesmerizing adventure, a fight for survival and, ultimately, a love story.	''	Romance	''

But turning that hunka hunka burnin love into an intimate bond comes no more naturally than learning to ride a bicycle or use chopsticks. What we are socialized to assume should be spontaneous and effortless requires patience and learned skills. Worse, should any problems erupt (you know, little things like kids, money or sex), we fear the relationship and we are irrevocably broken. We need help.  Open Hearts teaches those relationship skills. What makes it different is it is drawn from the lives of couples shattered by the ultimate betrayals of sex addiction. It takes principles learned in clinically treating couples shellshocked by shame and pain. Then it mixes them with spiritual steps drawn fr! om the authors own recovery to find healing hope in the hell of unimaginable hurt.  Though written by two noted psychologists, Open Hearts is not technical, but gentle and uplifting. Thats because authors Pat Carnes and Mark and Deb Laaser share how they found their way to joyous and fulfilling intimacy. Whats more, while these concepts originated in the recovery movement, they can transform any couple seeking renewal or trying to restore a broken relationship.  Open Hearts starts with basic truths: h We can only work on a relationship when were in that relationship. Running away never solved anything.  h If we have not resolved childhood developmental issues, we will seek out partners we think will resolve them. Always.  h Its perfectly healthy to fight. We just have to learn to do it better.  h As partners were often stuck in coupleshame. But working through it leads to true intimacy.  Open Hearts is a book a couple does together. It takes techniques Carne! s and Laaser developed in their psychotherapy practices and weaves them into a series of individual and joint exercises. It looks at tough issues: shame, anger, money, betrayal, sex, parenting. It encourages fun: drawing up a family motto, expressing spirituality together, taking gentleness breaks. It works.  Now these three authors address coupleship to show how a relationship, no matter how imperfect or new, can be transformed and restored to loving intimacy.  Join us in a gentle path to a renewed relationship.	''	Romance	''

Existence as a hated outcast is nothing new for a woman with such powerful secrets. The dragon, though? A tad unusual. This one has a human form to die for, and knows it.According to dragon law, Talaith is now his property, for pleasure...Or otherwise. But if Lord Arrogance thinks she\'s the kind of damsel to acquiesce without a word, he\'s in for a surprise...Is the woman never silent?

No, Briec has been spellbound by something altogether different - and if he doesn\'t tread carefully, what he doesn\'t know about human women could well be the undoing of his entire race...

K.  Chesterton as a prophetic figure whose thought was to be classed with that Burke, Butler, Coleridge, and John Henry Newman. When Chesterton died in 1936, T. S. Eliot pronounced that \'Chesterton\'s social and economic ideas were the ideas for his time that were fundamentally Christian and Catholic\'. But how did he come by these ideas? Eliot noted that Chesterton attached \'significance also to his development, to his beginnings as well as to his ends, and to the movement from one to the other\'. It is on that development that this book is focused.	''	Romance	''

It\'s not easy for him to fit into the upper crust, particularly because he\'s trying to hide how much he\'s attracted to other boys. Jeremy\'s story of breaking free from the strands of dishonesty, deceit, and self-doubt has its parallels to the tale of Pinocchio, but Nolan\'s queer take is totally contemporary: think the TV series The OC - girls with mean cheekbones, well-built guys with snotty attitudes, and Jeremy in the role of a queer Ryan Atwood. He\'s a good-looking kid, with a sleek swimmer\'s physique - and the swim team\'s champ is out to get him. He dates one of the smart-set girls in an attempt to keep his gay hormones at bay - but that doesn\'t do him much good. Nolan\'s debut novel is a kitchen sink of genres - coming of age, coming out, mystery, romance, erotica, even a dash of the supernatural - that add up to an impressive story about the passage from boyhood to manhood.
